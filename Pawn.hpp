* @brief Parameterized constructor.
* @param : A const reference to the color of the Pawn (a string).
*     Set the color "BLACK" if the provided string contains non-alphabetic characters (eg. numbers or symbols). 
*     If the string is purely alphabetic, it is converted and stored in uppercase.
*     NOTE: We do not supply a default value for color, the first parameter.
*           Notice that if we do, we override the default constructor.
* @param : The 0-indexed row position of the Pawn (as a const reference to an integer).
*          Default value -1 if not provided, or if the value provided is outside the
*          board's dimensions, [0, BOARD_LENGTH)
* @param : The 0-indexed column position of the Pawn (as a const reference to an integer).
*          Default value -1 if not provided, or if the value provided is outside the
*          board's dimensions, [0, BOARD_LENGTH)
* @param : A flag indicating whether the Pawn is moving up on the board, or not (as a const reference to a boolean).
*          Default value false if not provided.
* @param : A flag indicating whether the Pawn can double jump two spaces forward or not (as a const reference to a boolean).
*          Default value false if not provided.
* @post : The private members are set to the values of the corresponding parameters. 
*   If the provided color parameter is invalid (ie. not alphabetic), it is set to "BLACK"
*   If EITHER of the provided row or col are out-of-bounds,
*      that is between 0 (inclusive) and BOARD_LENGTH (not inclusive),
*      then BOTH are set to -1 (regardless of being in-bounds or not).
* @note Remember to construct the base-class as well using these parameters!

 *
 * EXAMPLE: If a pawn is movingUp and the board has 8 rows,
*           then it can promoted only if it is in the 7th row (0-indexed)
 * @return True if this pawn can be promoted. False otherwise.
